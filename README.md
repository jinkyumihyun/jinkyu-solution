# jinkyu-solution
This code is a short implementation of Design Patterns in C#.  I follwed MicroSoft coding style and 
based the implementation on OOP and SOLID principles while moving towards Functional Programming.  
Basically, this implementation is shells to contain contents when extended to become usable 
applications.  All projects compile successfully and work fine with Visual Studio 2022.  Please check them.  Thanks a lot.
